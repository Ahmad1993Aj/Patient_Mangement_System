# Patient_Mangement_System
Patienten_Mangement_System:

The project aims to build a web application using Spring Boot as the back-end framework and React as the front-end library. The application will be connected to a MySQL database to store user information such as name, username, and email.

Spring Boot will be used to develop the RESTful APIs that will allow communication between the front-end and the database. The APIs will be responsible for creating, reading, updating, and deleting the user information stored in the database.

React will be used to create the user interface and interact with the APIs. The front-end will provide a form where the user can enter their name, username, and email. The entered information will be sent to the back-end and stored in the database.

In conclusion, the project will create a web application that allows users to enter their personal information, which will be stored in a MySQL database using Spring Boot and accessed via React-based user interface.
